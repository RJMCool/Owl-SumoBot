# Owl-SumoBot
This is my Owl sumo bot design, and code. 

The Body:
The body has the dimensions of a width of 95mm,a length of 130mm, and 70 mm tall.
The space in the middle has the dimensions of a width of 85mm, a length of 120mm, and 65 mm tall. Being 5mm up. 
Then there are the holes which the dc motor mount which has a width of 25mm and 5mm up.
Then there are holes on the corners of the chassis for the IR sensor with a width of 10 mm and a length of 20 mm. Then holes for to screw the IR Sensor on with a width and length of about 3.7 mm.
Then there is a Ultrasonic Sensor Hole which is about 20 mm up. The length hole is about 51 mm. 
Finally there are about 6 small holes to connect with the Ramp are around a diameter of 2.5 mm. If you want to connect everything it should be form fitted but glue would help putting everything together. Such as with the Dc Motor Mount you would need to glue the bottom and the sides to fully connect the Dc Motor Mount and the Chassis wall. Then for the holes connecting with the ramp need a plug which is in the repository
